- 👋 Hi, I’m @dutchLuck, an ex-electronic engineer and ex-linux-sysadmin, who (generally) enjoys programming. I rue the pace of my self-education and I am a very slow creator of code.
- 👀 I’m interested in
<a href="https://time.is">time</a>
at a practical, non-theoretical, level and particularly interested in accurate computer time. I'm also interested in data acquisition and have started to develop
<a href="https://gist.github.com/dutchLuck/64375fbdff945f17347ceef2f6db74f3">code</a>
to retrieve and display information from a Photovoltaic Power system.
- 🌱 I’m currently back coding in C after a period of dabbling with AI and using it for a bit of a hand-up on Rust language programming, but I am happy to experiment with almost any procedural language.
My first formal education in programming was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran#:~:text=Fortran%20(%2Fˈf%C9%94%CB%90rt,%2Doriented)%2C%20generic%2C%20array">Fortran</a> on punched cards. Informally, I taught myself
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#:~:text=BASIC%20(Beginners'%20All%2Dpurpose,at%20Dartmouth%20College%20in%201963.">Basic</a> and I also started learning low-level programming by hand assembling National Semiconductor
<a href="http://www.oldcomputermuseum.com/mini_scamp.html">SC/MP</a> binary. Then I progressed on to Assembly language programming Motorola microprocessors (
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800">6800</a>, 6809 and 68000) and then on to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)">Pascal</a> &
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-the-c-programming-language-beginner-tutorial/">C</a>. I did a formal short course on C and later C++, but never really moved from C to C++. Somewhere along the way I picked up a bit of shell scripting knowledge and I also did a short course on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/java/">Java</a>. I spent time on learning <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and liked it because it just seemed to do what you would expect, but have since moved to <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> as it has libraries for just about everything. In addition, somewhere back in the mists of time I did a PLC programming course, a <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-au/shop/labview.html">Labview</a> programming course and I have also dabbled with a tiny bit of <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/">tcl/tk</a>.
