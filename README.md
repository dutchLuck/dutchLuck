- 👋 Hi, I’m @dutchLuck, an ex-electronic engineer, who (generally) enjoys programming. Unfortunately I am a very slow creator of code.
- 👀 I’m interested in time, particularly accurate computer time. I'm also interested in data acquistion and may develop code to retrieve information from a Solar Power system.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, but am happy to dabble with almost any procedural language. Many years ago I started learning programming by hand assembling National Semiconductor SC/MP binary, then I progressed on to Motorola microprocessors, then on to Pascal & C. 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can try emailing on dutchLuck at live dot com, but I don't guarantee 
a response.
