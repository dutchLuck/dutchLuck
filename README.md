- 👋 Hi, I’m @dutchLuck, an ex-electronic engineer and ex-linux-sysadmin, who (generally) enjoys programming. I rue the pace of my self-education and I am a very slow creator of code.
- 👀 I’m interested in time, particularly accurate computer time. I'm also interested in data acquistion and may develop code to retrieve information from a Photovoltaic Power system.
- 🌱 I’m currently revisiting C language programming, but I am happy to dabble with almost any procedural language. My first formal education in programming was Fortran on punched cards. Informally, I taught myself Basic and I also started learning low-level programming by hand assembling National Semiconductor SC/MP binary. Then I progressed on to Assembly language programming Motorola microprocessors and then on to Pascal & C. I did a formal course on C and later C++, but never really moved from C to C++. Somewhere along the way I picked up a bit of shell scripting knowledge. I spent time on learning Ruby and liked it because it just seemed to do what you would expect, but have since moved to python as it has libraries for just about everything. In addition, somewhere back in the mists of time I did a PLC programming course, a Labview programming course and I have also dabbled with shell scripting and a tiny bit of tcl/tk.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can try emailing on dutchLuck at live dot com, but I don't guarantee 
a response.
