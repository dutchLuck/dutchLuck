- 👋 Hi, I’m @dutchLuck, an ex-electronic engineer and ex-linux-sysadmin, who (generally) enjoys programming. I rue the pace of my self-education and I am a very slow creator of code.
- 👀 I’m interested in time, particularly accurate computer time. I'm also interested in data acquistion and may develop code to retrieve information from a Photovoltaic Power system.
- 🌱 I’m currently revisiting C language programming, but I am happy to dabble with almost any procedural language. My first formal education in programming was Fortran on punched cards. Informally, I taught myself Basic and I also started learning low-level programming by hand assembling National Semiconductor <a href="http://www.oldcomputermuseum.com/mini_scamp.html">SC/MP</a> binary. Then I progressed on to Assembly language programming Motorola microprocessors and then on to Pascal & C. I did a formal course on C and later C++, but never really moved from C to C++. Somewhere along the way I picked up a bit of shell scripting knowledge and I also did a short course on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/java/">Java</a>. I spent time on learning <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and liked it because it just seemed to do what you would expect, but have since moved to <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> as it has libraries for just about everything. In addition, somewhere back in the mists of time I did a PLC programming course, a <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-au/shop/labview.html">Labview</a> programming course and I have also dabbled with a tiny bit of <a href="https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/">tcl/tk</a>.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can try emailing on dutchLuck at live dot com, but I don't guarantee 
a response.
